            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                At Caflemo, we are committed to maintaining a safe and secure platform for all users. We have a strict zero-tolerance policy towards Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and any content that sexualizes, exploits, or harms children. Our mission is to prevent the sharing or distribution of such material and to protect all users, particularly minors, from harm.
            </p>
            <p>
