                <h2>How the journey began...</h2>
                <p>When we scroll through the photos in our album, we're transported to cherished moments from the past. In those tender instances, a smile gently spreads across our face, often without us even realizing it.</p>
                <p>Then, in some of these photos, you might spot a complete stranger in the background, their joy so palpable and genuine. They appear to be fully immersed in the moment, radiating happiness and savoring every second with a warmth that’s both touching and inspiring.</p>
                <p>It feels like such a missed opportunity if the person in the photo never gets to see it and relive that beautiful moment from another perspective. The joy and warmth captured in those images deserve to be shared, allowing them to experience the magic from a new angle.</p>
                <p>With this in mind, Caflemo came to life— created to share those fleeting moments captured in photos and offer others a chance to relive the memories they didn’t even realize were theirs.</p>
